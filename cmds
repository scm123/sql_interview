Both the statements will remove the data from the "customers" table but the main difference is that you can roll back the DELETE statement whereas you can't roll back the TRUNCATE TABLE statement.


    CREATE TABLE new_table  
    AS (SELECT * FROM old_table);   

        CREATE TABLE newcustomers  
    AS (SELECT *   FROM customers  WHERE customer_id < 5000);  


        ALTER TABLE customers  
      ADD customer_age varchar2(50);  

      ALTER TABLE customers  
  ADD (customer_type varchar2(50),  
       customer_address varchar2(50)); 

           ALTER TABLE customers  
      MODIFY customer_name varchar2(100) not null;  

      ALTER TABLE customers  
  DROP COLUMN customer_name;  

    ALTER TABLE customers  
     RENAME COLUMN customer_name to cname;  

         ALTER TABLE customers  
    RENAME TO retailers;  

    the main difference is that the temporary tables can't have foreign keys related to other tables.

    In Oracle, local temporary tables are distinct within modules. These tables are defined and scoped to the session in which you created it.
